MemeGenerator
=============

This is a simple Meme Generator iOS application written in Swift for iOS devices, specifically iPhones.

There are a couple of features that I am planning on implementing in the future. They include the ability to change the color of the text - maybe a color wheel as well as the capability to share directly from within the application.

If you are trying to learn Swift and/or iOS app development, I recommend checking out Paul Solt's (https://github.com/paulsolt) courses at his web site - http://learn.iphonedev.tv/course/make-iphone-apps-in-swift-for-ios8
